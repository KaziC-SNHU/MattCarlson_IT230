## Requirements & Goals
This course was designed as an introduction to the C# language, Visual Studio 2022, and WPF programs. 
The goal of this the final application 'WPFRegisterStudent' was to utilize the class object 'Course' to interact with a WPF window and 'register' for classes.
My program meets the requirements simply and effectively, with room to easily improve and attach any other vital information to the program. 
I don't believe that I did anything particularly unique, but I do believe that the program is simple and efficienct to use.

## WPF vs. Console
I believe that this program could have been programmed as a console app. Granted, it would need more particular input and be slightly less convenient, but it could have been done.
The benefit of utilizing WPF instead, however, is that it changes all of the prompting and typing into simple button presses that respond to the user's needs effectively and efficiently. It makes the program much more convenient as a whole.

## Strategy
Debugging and improving upon the original code was made rather simple due to the simplistic design of the class, as well as the availabilty of knowledge. I'm experienced with using Stack Overflow, Github, and various other sources to ask questions.
Alongside direct help, I also have access to the class textbook, as well as the official Microsoft documentation regarding C# (this was where I studied arrays, in particular).
Frankly, I believe the most 'innovative' I had to be at any point was simply finding more sources to review whenever I faced trouble understanding something in the textbook or within Microsoft's documentation. Either way, I always managed to find what I needed to complete the assignments efficiently.
